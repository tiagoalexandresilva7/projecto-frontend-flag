# Travel Blog

## Objective
The goal for this project is to build a Travel Blog with HTML, CSS, and JS / React.

## Features
### Homepage
#### Homepage Hero
- As the first thing people see when they visit your website, a hero section is the area that immediately shows up on the screen under your logo and menu
- Should contain one background image and a title
#### A list of travel locations
- Build a list of locations you travelled to
- The following information should be shown in the list:
	- The name of the city and country
	- The date of the visit (when you arrived)
	- A thumbnail of the city
#### A Map with the locations (optional)
- Add the location coordinates as pins on a Map
- More info below


### The detailed Blog page
- Header
	- City and Country name
	- The date of the visit (from and to)
- Gallery of images for the location
	- You can create your own gallery or use open source gallery frameworks
	- An example for vanilla HTML, CSS and JS
		- https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp
- A description of the travel (can be Lipsum, but it always looks nicer with real text)
- The current weather in the city 
#### How to show the current weather of the travel location
* You can fetch the current weather (including an icon) of the travel location using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Show it as part of the information of your travel location

### Add new location page
- A form to add new locations
- You can experiment with the various input elements, e.g. `<input type="date" />` or `<textarea>`
- The form does not need to be functional but when clicking submit a preview of the inserted data should be shown in the console log

### The Traveler page
- A page to showcase the author of the blog
- Be as creative as you want :)

## Bonus tasks
### JSON
* Create your own JSON file with all the blog data in the form of a Mock API

### Forecast
* Add the forecast for the next few days in the detail section of a city

### Map
- So far, we have not played around with embedding a Map. If you want to, feel free to play around with a Map API and how to integrate it in your app. You could then show the travel location on a map for every travel location.
* Feel free to use any Map APIs like Google Maps or MapBox
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview)
- [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com) I reccomend this one for easiness and good documentation

## Considerations
* The mockups provided are for example only, feel free to design/structure your site as you see fit;
* Have responsiveness in mind, do your best to make your website look good in both Desktop and Mobile browsers;
- When starting to implement, focus on creating the HTML and CSS first, JS becomes much simpler when you already have an UI to code for;
- Style your website at will, feel free to use a CSS framework like Tailwind, Bulma or Bootstrap;
- Use Wouter as the routing framework for React
- You are allowed (and even encouraged) to ask your classmates for help or help them;
- You can ask the teacher for support at any time
